This is a simple demonstrated project for the trajectory planning and control in Coppliasim with a two-link arm robot.

The trajectory for the robot arm is generated with the Position-Velocity-Time (PVT) trajectory interpolation, *i.e*, a polynomial trajectory interpolation approach.

The control of the simple robot arm is with PID joint position controllers.

There is a robot kinematics model for the two-link arm robot, pleas refer to the source code for details.



The demonstrated videos can be found as followsï¼š
